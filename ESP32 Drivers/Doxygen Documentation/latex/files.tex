Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{_e_k_f_8h}{EKF.\+h}} \\*Performs the EKF algorithm by combining readings from a 6-\/axis IMU to provide a good estimate of orientation. This component was added into the system to perform the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm based on sensor readings from an IMU where the gyroscopes are used for predicting the state estimates while the accelerometers\textquotesingle{} readings are used in the correction step to validate the predictions made in the previous step. To keep it as flexible as possible the definitions of the state transition and measurement functions along with their Jacobians was omitted from this file, instead they are defined in a seperate file and passed using pointers to the driver for it to call them during the algorithm }{\pageref{_e_k_f_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{esp__master__spi_8h}{esp\+\_\+master\+\_\+spi.\+h}} }{\pageref{esp__master__spi_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{_l_p_c_8h}{LPC.\+h}} }{\pageref{_l_p_c_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{_m_p_u___advanced_8h}{MPU\+\_\+\+Advanced.\+h}} \\*For changing the device\textquotesingle{}s configuration. This file includes all the function prototypes and macros for changing the configuration of the MPU6050 such as clock source, sample rate, enable data ready interrupt, etc... }{\pageref{_m_p_u___advanced_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{_m_p_u___basic_8h}{MPU\+\_\+\+Basic.\+h}} \\*For basic operation of the MPU6050. This file includes all the prototypes for the basic functions of the MPU6050 }{\pageref{_m_p_u___basic_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{_m_p_u___shared_8h}{MPU\+\_\+\+Shared.\+h}} \\*Shared functions and macros of the MPU6050. This file includes all the function prototypes, macros, and needed header files for the MPU\+\_\+\+Shared.\+c which has the definitions of all the functions that are needed by all the other source files of the MPU6050 library. It does not need to be included as all other files include it }{\pageref{_m_p_u___shared_8h}}{}
